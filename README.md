# temerold-specific-windows-setup

This is a collection of PowerShell scripts that can be used to automate a Windows 11 post-installation setup. The scripts are, and will be for the foreseeable future, customized for my personal use. However, I hope that they can be useful to others as well.

## TODO
- Set power mode to "Best Performance"

- Set screen timeout to more than 5 minutes

- Add S:\Program\PATH to path

- Standardize use of `-in` and `-contains`

- Make `--silent` a parameter with default value `$true`

- Set up `winget upgrade --all` as a cron job

- Replace Explorer libraries with Lagring directories

- Delete OneDrive

- Run Office installer

- Always expand taskbar

- Apply custom taskbar items

- Set up Duplicati backup

- Enable Explorer preview pane

- Customize lock screen

- Rename the computer

- Sync system time

- Create main script incorporating everything in an appropriate order
